# ðŸ“š Library Management System in Java

This is a simple **console-based Library Management System** developed using **Java**. It allows users to manage a collection of books with features like adding, removing, searching, borrowing, and returning books.

## Features

-  Add new books to the library  
-  Remove books by title  
-  Search books by keyword  
-  View all available and borrowed books  
-  Borrow books (mark as borrowed)  
-  Return borrowed books  
-  Real-time availability status (Available / Borrowed)

## Tech Stack

- Java (Core)
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Java `ArrayList`
- Java `Scanner` for user input

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Library-Management-System-Java.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Library-Management-System-Java
   ```
3. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac LibraryManagementSystem.java
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java LibraryManagementSystem
   ```

## Future Improvements

- Add file storage for saving book data
- GUI with JavaFX or Swing
- Advanced search filters
- Login/Signup system for users
- Book categorization (genre, year, etc.)

## Learning Outcomes

This project helped reinforce:
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- Data structures (ArrayList)
- Input handling using `Scanner`
- Real-world application structure in Java
